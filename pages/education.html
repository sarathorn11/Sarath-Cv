                    When I was told to write essay about my learning experience, I didn't know for sure what I was going to write about. However, some good thoughts came later. I think that the most useful and valuable experience is that I got from my parents and other people.<p class="p"> My parents have been with me for my whole life and hopefully they will be beside me in future. They always tried to help me with advices. What does learning experience mean? I believe it's not an easy question. In my essay I'll try to answer it.
                    I remember when I came home from a kindergarten being very disappointed. One of my friends brought quite a thick book to the kindergarten. He told us that he had read the whole book. Furthermore, he demonstrated us his amazing ability. I was five years old then and you can only imagine how I felt upset. When I told this history to my mother, she laughed at me and said that I was silly. On the morning of the next day I found very big and gaily colored ABC-book. I will never forget this nice book. Even now, I sometimes look through my first book. This is aquamarine book with a big number of pictures. Days passed very quickly. My Mom always found time to seat with me and teach me to read. In a few weeks I learnt names of all shops in my neighborhood. I read everything: titles of books and magazines, signs. Nevertheless, now I dodn't like read for a long time. So, it was almost impossible to make me reading. Now I realize that thas experience is one of the most valuable, because I can get everything from book. Book is the source of knowledge.</p>
